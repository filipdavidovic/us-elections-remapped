        Voter turnout is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot in an election. Eligibility varies by
        country, and the voting-eligible population should not be confused with the total adult population.
        Age and citizenship status are often among the criteria used to determine eligibility,
        but some countries further restrict eligibility based on sex, race, or religion. <br> <br>

        The historical trends in voter turnout in the United States presidential elections have been determined by the
        gradual expansion of voting rights from the initial restriction to white male property owners aged 21 or older
        in the early years of the country's independence, to all citizens aged 18 or older in the mid-20th century.
        Voter turnout in United States presidential elections has historically been higher than the turnout for midterm
        elections.
